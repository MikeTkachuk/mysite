      I'm a machine learning engineer from Kharkiv, Ukraine, currently in Toronto, ON. Though once a local biochemistry
      prodigy, I found myself having most fun in computer vision, reinforcement learning, and 3D stuff. I'm an R&D
      enthusiast at heart, always exploring and experimenting. I work x20 times better when in a small team so hit me up
      if you like to solve something together.
